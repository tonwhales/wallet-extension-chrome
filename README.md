## Getting Started

This is the development part of the project. To create a working extension you need to put the repository content folder in a new directory and create an "extension" folder next to it. Then put the `manifest.json` file from the repository there. `yarn build` will place the finished extension files in this folder, which can be used in the browser.

final state of folders:

```bash
ğŸ“‚ extension
  ğŸ“„ manifest.json
ğŸ“‚ repository-folder
  ğŸ“‚ pages
  ğŸ“‚ public
  ğŸ“‚ styles
  ğŸ“„ package.json
```
